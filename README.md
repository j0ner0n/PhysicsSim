# Physics Simulator

In this private project I am attempting to create a Physics Simulator from scratch in Java.

Currently the Simulator is only simulating Gravity and has a few options it can run in:

- **Predictive**: running on full processing speed to determine an outcome at given time
- **Real-time**: performing the simulation and output in realtime (slight drift due to Thread scheduling and other things)

There exists a currently working implementation of the Physics engine but no GUI has been implemented yet.
