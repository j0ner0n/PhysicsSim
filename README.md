# Physics Simulator

In this private project I am creating a Physics Simulator in Java from scratch.

The simulator is currently used to simulate **gravity in 3D space** and is capable of simulating [n-body-simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem) such as the Sun-Earth-Moon system over years with high accuracy and short runtime.

The simulator comes with a variety of features including 
- extensive output/logging
- collision detection and handling (physically accurate inelastic collision)
- easy and centralized customizability in the [Setup class](src/main/java/physicssim/Setup.java)
- real-time mode

The project is built with gradle but alternatively can also be run using the makefile.

### For Makefile usage:

- `make` or `make compile` will compile the code into a binary folder
- All documentation can be generated by running `make javadoc`.
- Use `make run` to generate your own simulation with output to terminal or `make log` to move output into a log file.
- `make clean` will remove docs, binaries and logs

---

Have a look into the `example.log` file and modify the `Setup.java` class for your customized simulation. If you need more detailed features, add those to the main `Sim.java` class. Please use constants and predefined objects of the `Util.java` class.

Example log file:

The current version is fully capable to simulate the collision and gravity segments of the Physics engine but no GUI has been implemented yet (looking into that).
